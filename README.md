# util.JS
A JavaScript Utility Tool. Implements over 28+ New Classes/Functions. And Some of them can be used for GAMING!

# Installing
You can either download the repository and extract the `core/` folder and get the JS file.<br>
Or you can implement using eCDN:
```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eduardo7881/ecdn/refs/heads/main/packages/libraries/utiljs-1.0.0/utiljs-1.0.0.js"></script>
```

# Usage
You can use using ```window.UtilJS``` or ```UtilJS```.
<br>UtilJS contains all the classes and functions.<br>
<br>I recommend to explore the JS file. I'm <strong>!Lazy!</strong> to do docs.
